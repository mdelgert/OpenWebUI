Huachao Mao's [REST Client extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) is an excellent tool for testing REST APIs directly within VS Code. It also allows you to use environment variables for dynamic request URLs, headers, and other data, making it easier to manage different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

Here's how to add and use environment variables with the REST Client extension in VS Code:

---

### 1. Define an Environment File
Create a file named `rest-client.env.json` in the root of your workspace (or any other folder you'd like to store your environment configuration in).

The file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "environment1": {
    "variable1": "value1",
    "variable2": "value2"
  },
  "environment2": {
    "variable1": "value3",
    "variable2": "value4"
  }
}
```

For example, to define different environments for `development`, `staging`, and `production`, your file might look like this:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "base_url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "api_key": "dev_api_key_123"
  },
  "staging": {
    "base_url": "https://staging.example.com",
    "api_key": "staging_api_key_123"
  },
  "production": {
    "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
    "api_key": "prod_api_key_123"
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Referencing Environment Variables in Your `.http` or `.rest` Files
You can reference these environment variables in your HTTP files using the following syntax:

```http
GET {{base_url}}/api/resource
Authorization: Bearer {{api_key}}
```

When you run this request, the variables `{{base_url}}` and `{{api_key}}` will be replaced by the values defined in the active environment.

---

### 3. Activate an Environment
To select an environment in REST Client:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for and select `REST Client: Switch Environment`.
3. Choose one of the defined environments in your `rest-client.env.json` file.

REST Client will use the selected environment's variables until you switch it again.

---

### 4. Using Default Variables
If an environment is not explicitly activated or a variable is not defined in the selected environment, REST Client will look for variables in a top-level `"$shared"` section of the `rest-client.env.json` file. This is useful for setting default values.

Example:

```json
{
  "$shared": {
    "timeout": "5000"
  },
  "development": {
    "base_url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "api_key": "dev_api_key_123"
  }
}
```

In this case, the `timeout` variable will be available everywhere unless overridden in a specific environment.

---

### 5. Inline Environment Variables
For quick testing or one-off requests, you can also define inline variables in the `.http` or `.rest` file using the `@name` notation:

```http
@base_url = http://localhost:3000
@api_key = dev_api_key_123

GET {{base_url}}/api/resource
Authorization: Bearer {{api_key}}
```

---

### Additional Tips
- **File Naming:** You can save your environment configuration in other files or paths by specifying `"rest-client.environmentVariables"` in your VS Code `settings.json`.
- **Dynamic Values:** For dynamic values like timestamps or UUIDs, consider combining REST Client variables with its built-in [dynamic variables](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient#dynamic-variables).

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and switch between different environments when working with the REST Client extension in Visual Studio Code.
